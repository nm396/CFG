		<h2>Food Replacements</h2>
		
		<h3>Cheese</h3>
		<p>Cheese can be a nice touch to many dishes. Do not fear there are options out there. Some better than others so it's worth trying some and finding your favourite. My personal favourite is <a href="http://www.violife.gr/#!our-products/cnfd">violife. </a>The original flavour is like a light chedder and melts quite nicely on pasta dishes or a pizza and can add a little something extra to your burger or sandwich. It can be found in health food stores, Holland and Barretts and larger supermarket stores generally stock it. </br> Check out this <a href="http://www.peta.org.uk/blog/10-vegan-cheeses-you-need-to-try-uk/">website</a> for other suggestions of cheese available in the UK</p>
		<h3>Eggs</h3>
		<p>There are many options for replacing eggs:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Chia Seeds</strong> 1 tbsp of chia seeds or ground flaxseeds with 3 tbsp of water acts well as a binding agent. Keep in mind Flaxseeds have a nutty flavour.</li>
				<li><strong>Bicarbonate of Soda and Vinegar</strong> Use 1 tsp of bicarbonate of soda with 1tbsp of  white vinegar per egg. This gives a fluffier result which is good for cakes and cupcakes. Cider vinegar works best as it is sweeter for desserts. Keep in mind this is not the best for a recipe that calls for 3 or more eggs where it can be good to use silken tofu or soya yoghurt. If you find the dough is too dry you can use vegetable oil in place of butter. </li>
				<li><strong>Bananas</strong> Bananas can help with adding moisture but they do come with a distinctive flavour which isn't ideal for all recipes. Try substituting 1 banana per egg.</li>
				<li><strong>Tofu</strong> Tofu can be used for scrambled egg or omelette dishes. Use plain tofu that hasn't been smoked or had flavours added. Black salt can add a sulfur taste although normal salt is also OK, with tumeric for colouring. See <a href="http://nm396.github.io/CFG/ScrambledEgg">here</a> for a recipe for scrambled egg.</br>Silken Tofu is good for a creamy texture when more than 3 eggs are required in a recipe.</li>
			</ol>
</p>

		<h3>Ice-cream</h3>
		<p>
		<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uGV9P8hbO_0/Tlw93zBBUdI/AAAAAAAAAQo/2-0Snhox41I/s1600/swedish_glace_frozen_dessert_e.jpg">Swedish Glace</a> is the most widely available and surprisingly delicious and creamy. I have some non-vegan friends who choose to buy this ice-cream it is so good.</br>
		<a href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=287168546"> Tesco Free From</a>Strawberry and vanilla cones.</br>
		Asda stock an almond and salted caramel non-diary<a href="https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/buying-and-supplying/new-product-development/almond-dream-launches-dairy-free-ice-cream/373038.article"> ice cream </a></br>
		<a href="http://www.boojabooja.com/ice-cream-new/"> Booja Booja</a> stock 6 delicious flavours although I've only seen these in health food stores.</br>
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni9kvH827Xs">Ben and Jerry's</a> have come out with 4 vegan flavours. These are unfortunately only available in the US at the moment but I am very excited about the day they make it over here.</br>
		If you are feeling adventurous you could also try making your <a href="http://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-brownie-chocolate-ice-cream/">own.</a>
</p>
		<h3>Butter</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://purefreefrom.co.uk/products">Pure</a> do a range of dairy free butters which are widely available. You can find spreads from olives, soya or sunflower oil.</br>
			<a href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=253250771&gclid=CKvG_qTv68sCFfAy0wodBfMBlw&gclsrc=aw.ds">Vitalife</a> and other <a href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=271895130&gclid=CNyvqe_v68sCFZEK0wodf0YApw&gclsrc=aw.ds">free from</a> brands are often available in most supermarkets or health food stores.</br>
			When cooking or baking, butter can also be replaced with cooking oil.
		</p>

		<h3>Milk</h3>
		<p>There are many options available for replacing milk, <a href="http://www.alpro.com/uk/products">Alpro</a> have a wide range from Soya milk (unsweetened or sweetened),  Almond, Hazelnut, Dark Chocolate, coconut, Rice, or Oat Milk</br>

		<p>
		<a href="http://www.alpro.com/uk/products?products=plant-based-yogurt-variation&ingredients=soya">Alpro</a> have both plain yoghurt replacements and fruit flavoured yoghurts. I can honestly tell you I couldn't tell the difference between these yoghurts and diary brands.</br>
		They also have <a href="http://www.alpro.com/uk/products?products=dessert&ingredients=soya"> dessert</a> yoghurts in chocolate and vanilla/custard.</br>
		KoKo have a range of yoghurts, which are slightly harder to find but I can highly recommend this <a href="http://www.kokodairyfree.com/product_specifications/newkoko_dairy_free_coconut_and_lemon_yogurt_alternative/">lemon</a> treat, which is like a melty lemon cheesecake.</p>

		<h3>Cream</h3>
		<p>
		<a href="http://www.alpro.com/uk/products?products=cream-variation&ingredients=soya"> Alpro</a> do a single cream replacement which is widely available. A plain yoghurt replacement can often also work.
	</p>

		<h3>Alcohol</h3>
		<p>
			You might be surprised at what alcoholic drinks are not even vegetarian. This is something you just begin to learn, for example Kopparberg use gelatin in the filtration process.
			<a href="http://www.barnivore.com/">Barnivore</a> is a vegan alcohol directory which is really useful for checking your beers, wines, and liquors on.
		</p>

		<h3>Quick Meals</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes you may not want to cook a fresh meal and just want a quick microwave or oven option. You are safe. There are options. All major supermarkets will have a vegetarian section in their freezers where you will find veggie burgers or bean burgers. <a href="http://www.lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/"> Linda McCartney</a> has a great range of sausages, pies, and sausage rolls. <a href="http://www.quorn.co.uk/vegan/"> Quorn</a> is even starting to make their products vegan. (They are currently using egg as a binding agent but are starting to change that)</br>
			<a href="http://www.bolfoods.com/">Bol</a> Do delicious microwave meals, with several vegan choices such as Sri Lankan Samba Dahl or Mexican Sweet Potato Chilli.
		</p>

		<h3>Meat Alternatives</h3>
		<p>
			Health food stores will have <a href="http://www.realfoods.co.uk/product/898/tvp-dark-mince"> soya protein mince</a> which just needs to soak in water until rehydrated before adding to your sauce or recipe.
			Holland and Barretts also have a wide range of <a href="http://www.vbitesfoods.com/">meat alternatives </a>such as Chorizo or Kebab meat as part of the Cheatin' or VegiDeli Range. They also have <a href="http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/granovita-mock-duck-60062253">Mock Duck</a> or a range or <a href="http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/search?query=pate&isSearch=true#so=sort_topseller&totalNumRecs=7"> Pate</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Chocolate</h3>
		<p>Dark Chocolate is often Vegan. If you have a sweeter tooth <a href="https://www.cadbury.co.uk/products/Bournville-2400?p=2400"> Bournville</a> is a good option.</br>
			There are diary-free Milk chocolate alternatives such as <a href="http://www.alternativestores.com/vegan-vegetarian-shopping/choices-dairy-free-en">Choices</a> which can be found in Holland and Barretts and some supermarkets. They have some options aimed for children as well.</br>

		<h2>Social</h2>
		<h3>At the Restaurant</h3>
		<p>
		Going out for meals can be frustrating as it's the only time you might feel restricted. There are some things that can make it easier though: 
		<ul>
			<li>If you are planning ahead and making a reservation ask beforehand if they can cater for you and the chef may even make you something off the menu.</li>
			<li>Look for vegetarian options and ask if adjustments can be made, this is often just not adding cheese, or sour cream.</li>
			<li>Always let the staff know you are vegan; what sounds safe on the menu may come with hidden extras. I once asked for curry sauce (knowing the sauce was vegan from the night before) and got a gravy boat of chicken curry. More common is a side of coleslaw</li>
			<li>Indian restuarants are always a safe option! You can have vegetable curries or lentil, chickpea or potato curries. You can even have onion bahjis and vegetable samosas and pakhoras</li>
			<li>Other 'safe' options include burrito bars or restaurants that make pizzas from scratch as you can have a vegetable pizza without cheese. <a href="https://www.pizzaexpress.com/news/vegan-giardiniera"> Pizza Express </a> have now got a pizza with vegan mozzarella and a cheese free piza. Good news for us as vegan options are becoming more and more popular. </li>
			<li>In cities you may be able to find a vegetarian/vegan restaurant that will be able to cater to your needs, possibly even with vegan cheese, mayonnaise and desserts!</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Day Trip</h3>
		<p>Do pack some food to bring with you, just in case</p>

		<h2>Clothing</h2>
		<h3>Shoes</h3>
		<p>
		Shoes can be made from leather, with glues derived from animal bones or even with dyes derived from animals. It can be hard to know but there are companies exclusively selling vegan shoes, such as <a href="http://www.vegetarian-shoes.co.uk/">Vegetarian Shoes</a>, <a href="https://www.beyond-skin.com/">Beyond Skin</a>, or <a href="https://www.ethicalwares.com/">Ethical Wares</a>.
		<h3>Dance Shoes</h3>
	</p>
		<p>Dance shoes are often made with a leather or suede sole to reduce friction. It can be difficult to find a pair of <em>affordable</em> vegan dance shoes but <a href="http://www.danceshoesinternational.com/taygra-slim-sole-39-c.asp">these</a> use recycled PVC to form hard ridges along the bottom to reduce friction for easier pivots and remain flexible. </p>
		<h3>Running Shoes</h3>
		<p>
		This<a href="http://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SHOE-GUIDE-OPT.jpg"> guide </a> to running shoes from Peta shows which companies make vegan running shoes, or check out their list for <a href="http://www.peta.org/living/for-men/the-ultimate-guide-to-vegan-running-shoes-for-men/">men</a> or <a href="http://www.peta.org/living/fashion/the-ultimate-guide-to-vegan-running-shoes-for-women/">women.</a>
		<h3>Clothing</h3>
	<p>Materials to avoid are leather, wool, silk, suede, and down. There are exclusively vegan stores but you can buy vegan clothing in most stores if you just check the labels. Faux fur and imitation leather will cost only a fraction of the price too.</p>
