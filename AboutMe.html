		<h1> About Me </h1>
		<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hNANhMb.jpg" alt="image of me">

		<p>Hello, I'm Naomi. </br>
		I love food! I think that's why going vegan hasn't been difficult for me. I like to try new and interesting recipes so the whole thing has been an exciting adventure for me.
		
		This isn't a "preachy" vegan website, I don't think that approach gets you very far. Before I went vegan I had admired those that could do it but thought it was just too hard for me, I mean it's so restrictive, right? and I have a massive sweet tooth so how could I give up cookies and chocolate?...</br> But then I met my current partner, who had been vegan already for 4 years, and when I saw what he could eat I realised there was so much that I thought. That's why I believe sharing food and experiences with eachother is the most valuable tool we have.</br>
		This website is for those who are curious about the vegan lifestyle and want some recipe ideas, it's also for the long-term vegans who have found themselves in a bit of a food rut.
		So please enjoy these recipes and share some delicious meals with your friends!

		<p>I was once told if you are going to be part of a group to have at least one joke on hand to be able to laugh at yourself; so here are some vegan jokes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> What do Vegan Zombies eat? </br> GGRRRaaaaIIIInnnSSS!!</li>
			<li> When I'm around an uptight vegan I tend to walk on eggshells, which really upsets them</li>
			<li>A vegan went to the doctor with a carrot sticking out of one ear, celery out of the other and said "Doctor, what's wrong with me?"</br> The doctor replied "well, for one thing, you're not eating right"</li>
