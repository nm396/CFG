		<p class='intro'>Hello, welcome! </br></br>
		First things first I love food! I think that's why going vegan hasn't really been difficult for me. I love to try new recipes, and experiment in the kitchen, so the whole thing has been an exciting culinary adventure for me.</br></br>
		
		This isn't a "preachy" vegan website, I don't think that approach gets you very far. It never gave me encouragement before I went vegan. I had admired those that could do it but thought it was just too hard for me, I mean "it's so restrictive, right? and besides I have a massive sweet tooth so how could I give up cookies and chocolate?...</br></br> But then I met my current partner, who had been vegan for 4 years already, and when I saw what he could eat I realised there was so much more available to me. There were more replacements than I realised, I just hadn't paid attention before. That's why I believe <strong>sharing food and experiences</strong> with eachother is the most valuable tool we have.</br></br>
		This website is for those who are curious about the vegan lifestyle and who want some recipe ideas, there's also advice on food replacements and information on <em>where you can get your protein</em>; it's also for the long-term vegans who have found themselves in a bit of a food rut.</br></br>
		So please enjoy these recipes and share some delicious meals with your friends! Oh and get <strong>creative in the kitchen. </strong>

		<p>I was once told if you are going to be part of a group to have at least one joke on hand and be able to laugh at yourself; so here are some vegan jokes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> What do Vegan Zombies eat? </br> GGRRRaaaaIIIInnnSSS!!</li>
			<li> When I'm around an uptight vegan I tend to walk on eggshells, which really upsets them</li>
			<li>A vegan went to the doctor with a carrot sticking out of one ear, celery out of the other and said "Doctor, what's wrong with me?"</br> The doctor replied "well, for one thing, you're not eating right"</li>
