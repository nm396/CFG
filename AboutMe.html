		<p class='intro'>Welcome </br></br>
		Most importantly you should know I love food! Surprisingly that's made going vegan so much easier. I love to try new recipes and experiment in the kitchen, so the whole thing has been an exciting culinary adventure for me.</br></br>
		
		I don't think the "preachy vegan" approach doesn't achieve much. The way forward lies in sharing delicious vegan food and showing people "what vegans can eat" and start to change the extreme and restricted stereotype.</br></br> 

		I have been vegan for slightly over a year, but I was lucky in that I was dating a long-term vegan. He could share his veganly wisdom and tips for me. This is my chance to share those tips with you so you can also find easier to succeed in vegan awesomeness</br></br>

		This is a collection of recipe ideas, some of my own, some from friends, and some from my favourite food bloggers. There's also a section for tips and useful websites. So whether you are intrigued to try a vegan lifestyle or a long-term vegan looking some inspirition enjoy these recipes! Go forth and share delicious meals with your friends.<br></br>
		 Oh and don't be afraid to get <strong>creative in the kitchen. </strong>

		<p>I was once told if you are going to be part of a group you need to have at least one joke on hand and to laugh at yourself; so here are some vegan jokes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> What do Vegan Zombies eat? </br> GGRRRaaaaIIIInnnSSS!!</li>
			<li> When I'm around an uptight vegan I tend to walk on eggshells, which really upsets them</li>
			<li>A vegan went to the doctor with a carrot sticking out of one ear, celery out of the other and said "Doctor, what's wrong with me?"</br> The doctor replied "well, for one thing, you're not eating right"</li>
		</ul>
