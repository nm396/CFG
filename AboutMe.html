		<p class='intro'>Welcome </br></br>
		My name is Naomi and I love food. I love food a lot! like... a lot!
		Honestly, I think that's what made going vegan so much easier. I love to try new recipes and experiment in the kitchen, so I've considered the whole thing a culinary adventure.</br></br>

		I was lucky to have someone show me the ropes and share their veganly wisdom with me. This is my chance to share those tips with you so you too can find it easier to succeed in vegan awesomeness.</br></br>

		This is a collection of recipe ideas, some of my own, some from friends, and some from my favourite food bloggers. There's also a section for tips (because sometimes we just need to know how to settle that craving) and useful websites. So whether you are new to the vegan world or a long-term vegan looking just some inspiration <strong>enjoy these recipes!</strong> Most importantly <strong>share delicious meals </strong> with your friends.<br></br>
		Oh and don't be afraid to get <strong>creative </strong> in the kitchen. 
		</p></br></br>

		<p>I was once told if you are going to be part of a group you need to have at least one joke on hand and to laugh at yourself; so here are some vegan jokes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> What do Vegan Zombies eat? </br> GGRRRaaaaIIIInnnSSS!!</li>
			<li> When I'm around an uptight vegan I tend to walk on eggshells...</br> 	...which really upsets them</li>
			<li>A vegan went to the doctor with a carrot sticking out of one ear, celery out of the other and said "Doctor, what's wrong with me?"</br> The doctor replied "well, for one thing, you're not eating right"</li>
			<li> What gun doesn't kill things? </br> A veGUN </li>
